## Loria

Loria is an on premise, highly modulable, inteligent and very personal assistant.

### On premise

Loria is hosted on your personal computer or server, it won't send any personal data to anyone. Actually, it won't send any data at all. It could work without Internet if you'd like so!

### Highly modulable

Loria works with modules and by building modules, you can hack Loria to the core! 

All modules are available to download with pre-installed nuget module from [nuget.loria.io](http://nuget.loria.io/).

### Inteligent and very personal assistant

As Loria works with modules, every Loria is different. Start building your own now!
